# Project Work
1) Drive the DC motor at a constant speed of half of the full speed.
2) Control the speed of the mototr using the on board potentiometer of LPC1768 and display the speed of the motor on the LCD display.
3) Control the direction of the motor rotation by the on board joystick and display the rotation direction on the LCD display.
4) Control both the speed as well as the direction of motor and display the speed and the rotation direction on the LCD display.
5) Control 2 motors to rotate both motors in the same direction for the ‘Up’ position of the joystick, in the reverse direction for the ‘Down’ position of the joystick, to rotate left side motor at half of the speed set by the potentiometer, and the right-side motor at full speed, for the ‘Left’ position of the 
joystick, to rotate right side motor at half of the speed set by the potentiometer, and the left side motor at full speed, for the ‘Right’ position of the 
joystick and to display the joystick position and the rotation speed on the LCD display.
6)  Measure the current drown by the motor and display the measured current on the LCD display.
